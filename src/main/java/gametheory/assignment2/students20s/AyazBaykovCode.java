/**
 * This class is an implementation of an actor for Game Theory Assignment 2
 * tournament. It can be initialized with those available strategies {random, greedy, buffer, update_buffer, buffer_greedy}
 * With default constructor buffer_greedy agent will be created.
 * Random - will always chose random next mode
 * Greedy - will always chose field with maximum X
 * Buffer - naive coop strategy where we assume that field A - is "buffer" zone and we distribute other 2 between
 * Update Buffer - same as buffer, but it we met opponent on other field, we assume that this is new buffer
 * Greedy Buffer - at each time says that field with maximum is the "buffer" - this is made to beat greedy opponents
