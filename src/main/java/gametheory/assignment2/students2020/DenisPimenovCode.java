    Common idea: keep tracking of the opponent's moves and calculate probabilities
    of each of his move based on the entire history. Calculate the expected payoffs
    for each of your moves, given the current mixed strategy of the opponent and
    possible payoffs from each field. Choose the best move by expected payoffs.
    Choose random between equal moves in order to be unpredictable and prevent unnecessary collisions.
    This also prevents from collisions with player with the same strategy
